# Better-Rest
This is an app that I created under the guidance of Paul Hudson.
The app finds out the time that you should get to bed based on three parameters: the amount of coffee you drank that day, the amount of sleep you desire and the time you want to get up. This app is built for iOS environment. The app uses CoreMl and CreateML to optimise the data I had fed in and created an algorithm for the app. 
The results might not be completely accurate, so if you have an important meeting tomorrow, kindly use at your own risk. Don't come running after my life if you miss it.
